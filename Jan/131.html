<h1>Hosting Files (WEB HOSTING)</h1>
For hosting we need : - Domain Name (purchased)
                      - Hosting Service (acts as a server)

Free Hosting Services:
                     - Little  to no control of domain name 
                     - Limited Tools
                     - Advertising & redirects
                     - Familiar look & feel across them
                
Paid Services:
               - more functionality
               - email filters (cron jobs)
               - database
               - list server
               - better Tools
               - support is available

<h2>CPANEL</h2>
=> interface for managing the site.
=> needs domain name & hosting service.
=> keeping files in filemanager from our local system.
-> alternative : SFTP

<h2>GITHUB PAGES</h2>
=> create repository with same name as account name.
=> create a repository and check in "master" on "github pages" in  settings.

<h2>SFTP</h2>
=> secure file transfer protocol
=> fast way to move files from local machine onto web (or) other machine.
=> need to find & install FTP client.
=> after installing find FTP address for host.
-> eg: winSCP, FUGU/cyberduck
