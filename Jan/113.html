Browser Wars:

               - W3C   => World Wide Web Consortium
               - WAI   => Web Accessibility Initiative

IETF  =>  focused on how different networks should collaborate.
W#C   =>  eviolution of HTML (which tags must be supported by browser)
WAI   =>  make sure no matter how people access web, 
          must have same ability to view/access the content.
